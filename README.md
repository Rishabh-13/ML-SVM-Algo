# ML-SVM-Algo
This repo contains codes for Support Vector Machine(SVM) algorithm in machine learning


### Support Vector Machine(SVM) in Machine learning  
* It is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression.  
* The objective of SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points.  
* It uses a technique called the kernel trick to transform your data and then based on these transformations it finds an optimal boundary between the possible outputs.  
* Here, in the code file we have worked on 3 different datasets : make_blobs, make_circles & load_digits, all imported from Scikit-learn library.
